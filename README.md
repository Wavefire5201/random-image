# random image

had a random idea to have a random image for my profile readme every time someone
reloaded the page so I made this project.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.8. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
